# Digital Twin-Enabled Post-Disaster Damage and Recovery Monitoring with Deep Learning: Leveraging Transfer Learning, Attention Mechanisms, and Explainable AI

This repository contains the code and related materials used in the article "Digital Twin-Enabled Post-Disaster Damage and Recovery Monitoring with Deep Learning: Leveraging Transfer Learning, Attention Mechanisms, and Explainable AI". The project explores integrating deep learning models with Digital Twin frameworks for effective post-disaster damage and recovery assessment using multi-temporal satellite imagery. Key components include neural networks (e.g., Multi-head Attention ShallowNet, InceptionV3, RegNet), and Explainable AI methods like Grad-CAM and Saliency Maps.
